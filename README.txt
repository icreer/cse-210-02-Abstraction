Over view:
This a game of Hi-Low. This is a gessing game. A card wil be drawn. You as the player job is to guess wither the next card 
will be higher or lower. The player gets 100 points if they get it they guess right but if they are wrong they loss 75 points.
There is 3 difficalty, easy, median, and hard. Depending on your difficalty will determan how many points you start out will.
Easy you start with 300 points. As for median you get to start with 150 points. As for hard you start with 0 points. Have fun playing.

Structure:
Number of classes = 3
Number of objects = 3
Number of function = 10


This is a game used for the Abstraction unit.

The ways that I used abstraction in this program is through the classes that I had 3 classes.
The three classes I had were a startgame, User, and Card classes. In those classes I created 3 objects.
The three object I crated were a game, havefun, and person. The man reason for all those object were to 
get the function in the classes to work. The power of these objects, classes and functions is in the ablilty to add to the program and debug.
In debuging it lets you just edit one function instead of haveing to find it in some random location.
The other power that this object lets you have is adding things on. In the orginal instruction of this game
there is nothing about user difficalty. But I was able to add it on very quicly due to I was able to add another
function to the User class instead of if I didn't I would have had to rearange all my code to be able to add that fucntion.

The orginal instruction for this project is at https://byui-cse.github.io/cse210-course-competency/abstraction/materials/hilo-specification.html

Note: That to run there was made on VScode and some modfication on launch.json were made in creating for it to run out of the terminal
